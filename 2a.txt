Node.js Console is a global object used to display different messages it contains two modules,
the Console Class, which has methods such as .log() and .error(), and the Global Console, which 
allows you to call upon any of the methods without declaring "console" before it.

Node.js Path allows you to work with pathways. It has verious methods, such as .basename() or 
.extname().

My favourite, Node.js Buffer is a global object and provides a way of handling streams of binary 
data. It has methods such as .byteLength() and .compare().





Geekcentral and W3 Schools used for information

Some files were moved around, however it should all still function correctly

The QAP took about an hour.
W3Schools was used a lot, but Geekcentral just for the first part of the QAP.
No friend involvement.
No instructor involvement.
The QAP was relatively easy, a 2 out of 5 or so, unless I did something horribly wrong.
